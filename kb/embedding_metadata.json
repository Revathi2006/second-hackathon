  "Scenario Based Talking Points - \n    1. Markets are too high, I wish to pay when markets fall\n    -   Specific due dates by which premium needs to be paid, and as you wait, your life insurance worth Rs. 10,00,000 has been reduced to NIL\n        You can choose to invest your monies in any of our debt oriented funds which have lower investment risk. For instance, our Bond Fund has 5 year annualised returns of 5.45%. You can switch to equity funds at any point when your views of the market changes.\n        Alternatively, through Auto-transfer Portfolio strategy option you can systematically move your monies from debt funds to equity funds",

  "4. Better alternatives available (e.g. Mutual funds/Business)\n    -   Compare future effective charges vs. alternative financial plans before you make a decision. As an example, in most mutual funds, the effective charge would be 2% due to expense ratios AND of course, these plans do not provide you life insurance cover for which you have to set aside monies separately.\n        In your policy, the effective charges reduce and your returns get closer to the actual fund return. Effective charges for the rest of the policy term is 1.61% under 8% gross returns scenario.\n        Loyalty additions of 22,000 @ 8% returns scenario over the policy term. Such benefits are not available in alternative instruments such as mutual funds.",
  "5. Low/unsatisfactory returns in policy\n    -   You have earned annualised effective returns (post deduction of all charges and taxes) of 11.47%\n        In your policy, the effective charges (including the cost of life insurance cover and taxes) reduces sharply post the lock-in period . Effective charges for the rest of the policy term is 1.61% as against an effective charge of 3.89% till date\n        In case you are dissatisfied with your fund performance you can switch your monies to any other funds in the product based on your risk appetite",
  "6. Buying a new policy\n    -   Another ULIP policy: ULIPs have higher charges in initial years compared to later years. Hence it is not wise to purchase a new ULIP by surrendering/discontinuing an existing policy. In case of your policy the effective charges for rest of the policy term is only 1.61% which would be much cheaper than that in a new ULIP policy.\n        A traditional savings plan: Your asset allocation should be diversified and hence while purchasing a traditional plan can do that, you could also look at diversifying your asset allocation by switching part of your funds to a debt fund available"
